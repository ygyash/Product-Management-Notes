# ISB Product Management - Week 2: Product Development Process

## Module Overview

The second week focuses on the product development process, using a design thinking approach that starts with customer needs and ends with designing an effective offering. The module covers:

1. Overview of the product development process
2. Customer needs and behavior
3. Role of marketing in product development
4. Creating value for customers

## 1. New Product Development Process

### Structure and Stages

The process follows a funnel approach with four main stages:

1. **Fuzzy Front End**
   - Begins with opportunity identification and idea generation
   - High uncertainty about final product form/shape
   - Multiple possibilities exist
   - Ideas can come from R&D, personal insights, or market opportunities

2. **Design Stage**
   - Involves concept testing and development
   - Eliminates most possibilities through testing
   - Designs both product and marketing strategy
   - Creates complete value proposition

3. **Test Stage**
   - Uses pre-test marketing systems (e.g., Assessor, Basis)
   - Conducts test marketing
   - Simulates actual launch conditions
   - Reduces risk of failure

4. **Launch Stage**
   - Final product launch
   - Implementation of marketing strategy

### Key Characteristics

- Based on design thinking approach
- Systematic process improves success odds
- Flexible implementation based on context
- 30-60% failure rate for new products
- Process significantly improves success chances

## 2. Customer Needs and Behavior

### Types of Customer Needs

1. **Existing Needs**
   - Present in consumers' minds
   - Easily expressed when asked
   - Can be understood through traditional research methods
   - Example: Need for a lighter, more powerful laptop

2. **Latent Needs**
   - Not realized by consumers
   - Difficult to express directly
   - Requires indirect research methods
   - Example: Need for products like Sony Walkman before its invention

### Understanding Customer Needs

- Multiple layers to customer needs
- Core needs must be satisfied first
- Additional features build on core functionality
- Example: Children's toothbrush
  - Core need: Comfortable and safe brushing
  - Additional features: Colors, cartoon characters

### Research Methods

1. **Traditional Methods** (for existing needs)
   - Surveys
   - Interviews
   - Direct questioning

2. **Indirect Methods** (for latent needs)
   - Observational techniques
   - Ethnographic research
   - Behavioral analysis

## 3. Role of Marketing

### Marketing Management Process

1. **Strategic Marketing**
   - Understanding customer needs and behavior
   - Market segmentation (S)
   - Targeting specific segments (T)
   - Positioning in the market (P)

2. **Marketing Mix (4 P's)**
   - Product
   - Price
   - Place (Distribution)
   - Promotion

### Integration with Product Development

- Fuzzy Front End aligns with strategic marketing
- Design stage corresponds to marketing mix decisions
- Test stage validates marketing strategy
- Launch stage implements the complete marketing plan
